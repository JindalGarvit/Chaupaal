# Chaupaal conventions

Binding rules for navigation, overlays, media, and persistence. All new features and Cursor passes should follow this document.

Implementation lives primarily in:

- `public/src/js/core/nav-stack.js` — overlay history stack
- `public/src/js/core/overlay-scope.js` — scoped cleanup when parent views close
- `public/src/js/core/media-player.js` — shared seek/skip controls
- `public/src/js/features/music-card.js` — in-app music preview

---

## 1. Navigation & overlay contract

**Single entry point:** Every full-screen view, modal, sheet, or dismissible overlay must register through `pushNavLayer()` / the nav-stack observer — not ad-hoc `history.pushState` / `replaceState`.

**Exceptions (deep routes only):** `deeplinks.js` may push `{ chaupaalDeep: true }` when opening shareable routes (`/chat/…`, `/profile/…`, `/post/…`). Closing a deep route must use `history.back()`, never `pushState('/', …)`.

**One layer = one history entry:** Each real overlay gets exactly one `{ chaupaalLayer: true }` push. Overlays that call `pushNavLayer` manually must set `data-nav-managed="1"` so the MutationObserver does not double-register.

**Dismissal:** Tap-outside and system/gesture back must close exactly one layer via `removeNavLayer` / `popstate`. Parent views (e.g. chat) use `beginOverlayScope` / `endOverlayScope` so nested overlays clean up when the parent closes.

**Recovery:** If the stack and visible UI diverge, call `recoverNavStack()` — do not leave the user with a dead back button.

**Non-layers:** DOM injected for media controls, progress bars, or other inline UI must use `data-nav-ignore="1"` and must never match overlay selectors.

## 2. Media / audio-video contract

**No history interaction:** Play, pause, seek, volume, and buffering state changes must never call `history.pushState`, `replaceState`, or `back`.

**Single music preview:** `music-card.js` owns one shared `Audio` element app-wide. Starting playback on a new card pauses the previous card.

**Cleanup:** Every `bindMediaControls()` call returns a cleanup function; re-bind only after calling the previous cleanup. Components that mount media must remove listeners on dismiss (`chaupaal:dismiss`, overlay close, tab hide).

**Pause on navigation:** Music pauses when chat/story overlays dismiss (`pauseAllMusic`) and when the document becomes hidden.

---

## 3. Popup / modal contract

Dismissible surfaces inherit:

- Backdrop / scrim tap → dismiss
- System back / Escape → dismiss top nav layer
- Swipe-down on bottom sheets (via `touch.js`)

Do not re-implement per-feature back handling when building through nav-stack. Provide a close control with `[data-overlay-dismiss]` or a known close selector.

---

## 4. Persistence contract

Any message, attachment, story card, or rich bubble type must **render identically from stored Firestore fields after reload** as at send time.

- Persist all fields needed to hydrate UI (not in-memory-only state).
- After loading messages/stories, call the appropriate `mount*` helper (`mountMusicCards`, `mountLocationCards`, etc.).
- New attachment types must follow the same pattern as `music`, `location`, and `attachment` in `streak.js` / `sendRealtimeMessage`.

---

## Checklist for new features

- [ ] Overlay registered via nav-stack (`pushNavLayer` + `data-nav-managed` if manual)
- [ ] No direct `history.*` except deeplink routes
- [ ] Media does not touch history; listeners cleaned up on dismiss
- [ ] Firestore payload includes all fields needed to re-render after reload
- [ ] Tap-outside and back dismiss work without custom one-offs

---

## 5. Payments contract

All paid features must go through `server-lib/payments.js` and write to `chaupaalTransactions` with a `purpose` tag (`boost_post`, `premium_subscription`, `companion_gift`, …). Do not invent per-feature payment ledgers. Gate live charging with `PAYMENTS_ENABLED` (default off). Never simulate a successful charge while the kill switch is off.

## 7. Auth & identity

See `.cursor/rules/auth-identity.mdc`.

- One Firebase Auth user (email **or** phone, verified) → many profiles, no hard create cap; switcher uses `activeProfileId`.
- Verify email/phone with OTP (or Firebase email/phone verification) before treating them as registered.
- Persist login on device until explicit logout.
- Username unique; rename frees the old name immediately.
- Soft reset OK for pre-launch (re-register).

## 8. Outbound links & display names

- User-generated URLs go through shared `linkify.js` + leave-Chaupaal interstitial. Server check is `POST /api/media-config` `{ action: 'check_url' }` → `server-lib/url-safety.js` (Google Web Risk Lookup when `GOOGLE_WEB_RISK_KEY` is set; heuristics otherwise). Never skip the interstitial.
- User display names in HTML should render via `formatDisplayNameHtml(name, profileTypeOrUser)` so the Professional seal badge stays consistent. Do not invent per-surface badge markup.
- Denormalized user blobs (`c.user`, post authors, chat peers, story owners, typing payloads, etc.) must include `profileType` at write time. For older docs missing the field, call `enrichUsersWithProfileType` (batched uid lookup + short TTL cache in `profile-type-enrich.js`) before render; fall back to no badge if unresolved. Delete the enrich helper once old content ages out.

## 9. Service worker / PWA updates

- `public/sw.js` must call `skipWaiting()` on install and `clients.claim()` inside the activate `waitUntil`.
- Activate must delete every Cache Storage entry whose name is not the current `CACHE`.
- HTML shell (`/`, `/index.html`, navigations, `destination=document`) is **network-first**; never cache-first. Do not return `index.html` as a fallback for failed JS/CSS fetches.
- Client (`service-worker.js`) shows a tap-to-reload banner on updates and reloads once when the SW cache version changes.
